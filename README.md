# Feature Engineering and Data Analysis Project

This repository contains the Python notebook and supplementary files for my feature engineering and data analysis project. The project showcases data preprocessing, feature creation, and visualization techniques using Python libraries in Jupyter Notebook.

## Project Overview

The main objectives of this project are:

1. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset.
2. Engineer new features to improve model performance.
3. Visualize data insights and transformed features.

## Key Steps in the Analysis

### 1. Data Cleaning
- Handling missing values
- Removing duplicates
- Converting data types

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Summary statistics
- Distribution plots
- Correlation heatmaps

### 3. Feature Engineering
- Creating new features from existing ones
- Encoding categorical variables
- Feature scaling (e.g., normalization, standardization)

### 4. Insights and Visualizations
- Visualizing trends and patterns
- Highlighting key findings


## Technologies Used
